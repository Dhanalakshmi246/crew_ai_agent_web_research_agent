# crew_ai_agent_web_research_agent
This project is an intelligent research assistant built using CrewAI, Groqâ€™s LLaMA 3-70B, and Exa real-time web search API. It simulates a multi-agent system where one AI agent performs focused web research while another agent summarizes the results in a student-friendly format.
